## 👀 Introduction

Recent advancements in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have shown promising results in mathematical reasoning within visual contexts, with models approaching human-level performance on existing benchmarks such as MathVista. However, we observe significant limitations in the diversity of questions and breadth of subjects covered by these benchmarks. To address this issue, we present the MATH-Vision (MATH-V) dataset, a meticulously curated collection of 3,040 high-quality mathematical problems with visual contexts sourced from real math competitions. Spanning 16 distinct mathematical disciplines and graded across 5 levels of difficulty, our dataset provides a comprehensive and diverse set of challenges for evaluating the mathematical reasoning abilities of LMMs.

  The accuracies of four prominent Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), random chance, and human
performance are evaluated on our proposed <b>MATH-Vision (MATH-V)</b> across 16 subjects.

Through extensive experimentation, we unveil a notable performance gap between current LMMs and human performance on MATH-V, underscoring the imperative for further advancements in LMMs.

## 📈 Evaluation

### Generating Outputs of Different Models

#### Gemini

`python models/Gemini.py --in_path ./data/test.jsonl --save_path ./Gemini.jsonl`

This will run the Gemini API and save the outputs to `./Gemini.jsonl` path. You can modify the system prompt, max tokens, etc. in the `benchmark_gemini` function.

#### GPT_with_caption

Generate image captions using GPT-4V:

`python models/GPT_with_caption.py --model gpt-4-vision-preview --in_path ./data/test.jsonl --save_path ./data/gpt4v-captions.jsonl`

Generate outputs using ChatGPT-3.5 or GPT-4 with image captions:

`python models/GPT_with_caption.py --model gpt-3.5-turbo-0125 (gpt-4-turbo-preview) --in_path ./data/test.jsonl --save_path ./gpt3.5_caption.jsonl (./gpt4_caption.jsonl)`



### Evaluation of Model Outputs

Once all the model outputs have been generated, execute the `python evaluation/evaluate.py` function to assess these outputs. This script will examine all outputs located in the `outputs/` directory, computing overall accuracy as well as accuracy for each subject and level.

You can refer to the Appendix E and F of [the paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14804.pdf) for some evaluation results of the above models.
